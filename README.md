# Password-Generator

## Description

Given starter code, the goal was to create a dynamic webpage that used Javascript to take users through prompts. After answering all prompts, the website would generate a password using only what the user asked for.


## Usage

This website can be used in order to generate a password that can provide greater security.

When the 'generate password' button is clicked, the user is taken through prompts which then leads to a randomized password. The prompts allow the user to choose the password's length(between 8 and 128 characters) and whether or not they want to include special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, or lowercase letters.

Once the user goes through all the prompts, the generated password is displayed on the page.
